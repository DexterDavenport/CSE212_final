# Stacks
Stacks is a data structure that uses the LIFO (last in, first out) method. This is used as a way to prioritize the order in which task are complete within your program. 

# I. Pringles
A good example of the LIFO rule would be to look at a can of Prigles. With this, the factory will load all of the chips into a cylinder can. The first chip in the can will go to the very bottom. Every following chip will be placed on top of the previous chip. With this, the first chip that he consumer can access is the last chip that was placed into the can. The last chip in is the first chip out.

# II. Terms
Some of the terms that you need to understand when working with stacks are: Push, Pop, Front, and Back

* Push - This is when you place an item into the stack
* Pop - This is when you remove an Item from the stack
* Front - Using the Pringle example, This would be the bottom of the can/ the first chips placed into the can
* Back - This refers to the side with the most recent items added to the stack
